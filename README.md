# Employee Tracker

Developer: Sydney Mercier

For: UT Austin Coding Bootcamp

## Overview

This is an employee management system CLI app made using Node.js, MySQL, and Inquirer. It allows users to create or view existing employees, departments, and roles, as well as update employee roles. The code includes a database schema and seeds to get started.

## Demo

Demo video can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S-y2Bp7Bry0LRsliNndrxPWtUv6Ytjct/view).

## Future Development

The current functionality is somewhat limited, so in the future I would like to add options to delete items, to view employees by department or manager, and to update employee managers.
